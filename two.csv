,Late Knighter,"Karoke: It was very fun and well participated! People got into the songs and there was dancing and laughter. Board game room: Kind of slow, but still a good idea for the kids that didnt want to be with the crowds. Faculty vs Students Basketball game: It was a success! Most of the people that came to the Late Knighter were there for the Basketball game. We had a good energy, we played music the entire game, the halftime was super fun and people really enjoyed themselves!"
